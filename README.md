# Classification of Seismic Sources in Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and tools developed for my master's thesis at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), titled: 

**"Classification of Seismic Sources in Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Using Machine Learning"**

## Project Overview

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) enables the transformation of fiber-optic cables into distributed seismic sensors. This project aims to develop machine learning models that can classify seismic events in DAS data, with a focus on avalanche detection in northern Norway.

**Key goals:**
- Develop a CNN-LSTM based classification pipeline.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of preprocessing techniques (wavelet transforms, STFT) in improving model robustness in noisy environments.
- Open-source the tools for reproducibility and future research.
